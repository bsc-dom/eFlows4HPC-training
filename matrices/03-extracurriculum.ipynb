It's easy to get out of memory errors; and the complexity is $O(n^3)$, so it's easy to end up with very long execution times. For reference, try 8192x8192 matrices on 5 nodes as a good starting point.\n",

You can follow the basic patterns of decorators and annotations already present in the matrix multiplication application. Remember to use the `@task` decorator for PyCOMPSs (probably above a new method on the _Block_ class) as well as `@dclayMethod` in all methods that you add."
